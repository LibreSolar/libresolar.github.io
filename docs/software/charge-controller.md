GitHub repository: [LibreSolar/charge-controller-firmware](https://github.com/LibreSolar/charge-controller-firmware)

## Features

- Running on [Zephyr RTOS](https://www.zephyrproject.org/)
- STM32F0, STM32L0 and STM32G4 series MCUs
- Different battery types supported (lead-acid, Li-ion)
- Monitoring of voltage, current and temperature
- Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm based on Perturb and Observe (P&O)
- Load output with deep-discharge protection
- CAN bus and serial interface with [ThingSet protocol](thingset.md)
- OLED display support

## Supported boards

The software is configurable to support different charge controller PCBs with STM32F072, low-power STM32L072 or most recent STM32G431 MCUs:
