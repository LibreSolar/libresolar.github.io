# MPPT charger (10A) with dual USB output

![Development Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/development%20stage-eval-yellow.svg) Tested prototype, evaluation boards available.

This charge controller is based on the [20A MPPT](/devices/mppt-charger-20a/), but has reduced number of components and cheaper DC/DC power stage for 10A.

The power is sufficient for small 12V applications with up to 150 W solar panels.

With the integrated dual USB output you can directly charge your mobile phone or power other devices such as Raspberry Pi.

## Buy development board

You can buy a fully assembled board as shown in the picture above. It uses SMD LEDs which can be replaced by THT LEDs depending on the application.

The board comes without a housing. Suitable CAD files for 3D printing can be found [here](https://github.com/LibreSolar/charge-controller-housings/tree/master/MPPT-PWM-xUS).

Please check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LibreSolar/MPPT-1210-HUS) for full technical details and a manual.

**Important:** This is a development board for evaluation and requires expert knowledge to use it, including flashing [the firmware](https://github.com/LibreSolar/charge-controller-firmware). It is not a product for normal end users, yet.
