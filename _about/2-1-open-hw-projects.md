This page lists a few other Open Source Hardware projects related to energy conversion and monitoring.

### Collective Open Source Hardware (cos-h)

This collective based in Hamburg rebuilt and documented some of the Libre Solar components and integrated them to a Solar Box. The Solar Box can be used for mobile energy storage. The build-up process is documented with lots of good pictures and descriptions.

### Connected Energy

We are partnering with the UK-based Connected Energy Technologies Ltd. to provide open source energy systems for people off the grid in rural areas. The open source enables localized, distributed manufacturing of the devices.

### Open Energy Access Alliance

As co-founders of the Open Energy Access Alliance we want to join forces to facilitate access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy sources, in line with the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goal 7.

### Open Source Ecology (Germany)

Libre Solar collaborated with OSE Germany and built some devices together. You can find descriptions of the projects in their Wiki.

### OpenEnergyMonitor

Open Energy Monitor provides an entire framework including software and hardware for monitoring of your household energy consumption and generation (e.g. through PV panels). In the online shop you can directly buy the hardware.

### SBMS100 by Dacian Todea

The Solar BMS (Solar Battery Management System) is a powerful 100A solar charge controller including a BMS for 3 to 8 Lithium ion cells. This solar charge controller does not feature Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) because of good reasons (see Dacians video explanations for this).
