The primary ideas of a smart, distributed and hackable DC energy system emerged from discussions during the [POC21 innovation camp](http://www.poc21.cc/) near Paris in September, 2015. We were planning to combine different renewable energy sources of the single projects (solar generator, $30 wind turbine, bicycle generator) into a system which would be able to provide energy for small household consumers, green houses, electric bikes, etc.. The only problem: There were no open-source and hackable power electronics devices available which would fulfill our needs.

Since then, we are trying to close this gap and develop flexible solar charge controllers, mobile solar systems and battery management systems as open-source hardware projects.

The Libre Solar project is closely linked to the [Fablab Fabulous St. Pauli](http://www.fablab-hamburg.org/), where we can use equipment like laser cutter and reflow oven to build prototypes.
