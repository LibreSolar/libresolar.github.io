In addition to that, up to three temperature sensors (10k thermistors) can be connected to the board. The board features a CAN interface through two daisy-chained RJ-45 connectors. Via the universal UEXT connector, additional peripherals can be connected via SPI, I2C or USART.</p><p>The Switch-N-Sense board acts as the interface between the Li-ion battery and the outside world. It contains the sense resistors for current measurement and charge/discharge MOSFETs at the bottom side. For improved cooling, it can be attached to a cooling plate. The wire-to-board connection is done via Würth Power Element press-fit connectors, allowing very high currents.</p><p>The two boards are separated in order to adjust the power part depending on your actual needs. If you only need to deliver low currents from the battery, the Switch-N-Sense board can be smaller and cheaper.</p><p>Please find a good description about system integration of the BMS in the <a href="https://wiki.opensourceecology.de/24-48V_BMS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Open Source Ecology Wiki</a> (in German).</p>',15)]))}const u=t(n,[["render",i]]);export{p as __pageData,u as default};
