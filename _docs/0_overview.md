This section describes most important aspects of the Libre Solar open source hardware components:

- System layout (DC nanogrid)
- Hardware design and ordering
- Software toolchain and flashing
- ThingSet communication protocol

In addition to that, we are working on an Open Educational Resource (OER) that explains how to develop, produce and use components in DC energy systems. Visit the independent website to check it out:

**Building DC Energy Systems** at [learn.libre.solar](https://learn.libre.solar)

As it is also an open project, feel free to contribute if you have remarks or improvements.
