Once the PCB and all parts have been ordered, the parts have to be assembled to the PCB.

For most of the parts this can be done by hand (there are plenty of guides on the internet how to hand-solder also small SMD parts). However, for some parts with pads on the bottom of the parts, you need a reflow oven.

This guide will explain the basic steps needed to assemble the PCBs.


## Materials

- PCB (see previous step)
- Parts (see previous step)
- Soldering paste
- Stencil material (e.g. Mylar foil, paper)
- Tape


## Tools

- Laser cutter
- Reflow oven
- Tweezers
- Squeegee


## SMD parts (reflow soldering)

### Preparation

- PCB printout and place SMD parts

## THT parts
