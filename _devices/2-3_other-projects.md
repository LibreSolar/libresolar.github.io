This page lists a few other Open Source Hardware projects related to energy conversion and monitoring.

## SBMS100 from Dacian Todea

The Solar BMS (Solar Battery Management System) is a powerful 100A solar charge controller including a BMS for 3 to 8 Lithium ion cells. This solar charge controller does not feature Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) because of good reasons (see Dacians video explanations for this).
