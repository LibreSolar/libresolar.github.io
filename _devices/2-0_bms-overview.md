There are several different versions of battery management systems available. The main distinctive feature is the number of cells that can be supervised, which defines also the maximum voltage of the BMS. In addition to that, the maximum current is important, which defines the maximum power together with the system voltage.

The different Libre Solar BMS types are named according to the following schema:

`BMS [Maximum number of series connected cells]S[Maximum current] [Features]`

The possible additional features are listed in the following table:

| Abbreviation | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| I | Integrated BMS: Balancing, load switches and current measurement are integrated on a single PCB |
| S | Separate PCB for power part (switches and current measurement) and control part (incl. cell balancing) |
| C | CAN bus communication port |
