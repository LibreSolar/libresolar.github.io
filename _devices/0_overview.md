The vision behind Libre Solar is to develop open-source hardware components for a smart and renewable energy system.

Currently, different versions of MPPT charge controllers and battery management systems (BMS) are under development. The development stage of the devices is marked with the following badges:

![Development Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/development%20stage-alpha-red.svg) Very early development stage, major issues expected.

![Development Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/development%20stage-beta-orange.svg) Prototype built, development ongoing (major issues might still be open).

![Development Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/development%20stage-release%20candidate-yellow.svg) Tested prototype, only minor issues left.

![Development Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/development%20stage-release-green.svg) Device ready for production.

Unless stated otherwise, none of the published devices has passed regulatory certification, so use them at your own risk and responsibility (see also [CC-BY-SA license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode)).

We are planning to release some of the devices as fully certified products that can be bought either fully assembled or as a kit. Until then you will have to assemble the devices yourself.
