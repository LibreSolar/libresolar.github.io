![Development Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/development%20stage-alpha-red.svg) Very early development stage, major issues expected.

Battery management system for up to 8 Li-ion cells based on Intersil ISL94202 IC.

## Features

- 3 to 8 Li-ion cells (e.g. LiFePO4)
- Integrated high-side MOSFET switch and current sensor
- Balancing current approx. 150 mA
- STM32F072 ARM Cortex M0 microcontroller
- Built-in CAN communication interface and UEXT extension connector

## Development

The BMS is under active development and you are welcome to participate.
