# Our Mission

Clean energy from renewable sources should be accessible to all. Otherwise, how will we ever manage to limit global warming and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals?

Unfortunately, the energy supply of many countries is still controlled by a few large fossil fuel companies that are trying to maintain the status quo. Their large coal and nuclear power plants should be replaced by millions of small, decentralised renewable energy generators.

Our mission is to help provide energy access for all and to reclaim the energy supply with affordable renewable energy solutions based on open source hardware.

Libre Solar's primary focus is on solar power generation and storage for both off-grid and grid-connected applications. Accordingly, the first open source hardware projects are an MPPT charge controller and a battery management system for lithium-ion batteries.
